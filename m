Dear All,

The label redefinition in inline ASM was fixed. The actual error is due
to the function was called more  than 3 times and in every place the
code was replaced. So, it was showed the redefinition error. However, by
looking at the following paragraph and links, I have fixed the error.

GCC allows (and requires) you to specify register constraints in your
inline assembly code, so the optimizer always know about it; thus,
inline assembly code is really made of patterns, not forcibly exact
code.

Thus, you can put your assembly into CPP macros, and inline C functions,
so anyone can use it in as any C function/macro. Inline functions
resemble macros very much, but are sometimes cleaner to use. Beware that
in all those cases, code will be duplicated, so only local labels (of 1:
style) should be defined in that asm code. However, a macro would allow
the name for a non local defined label to be passed as a parameter (or
else, you should use additional meta-programming methods). Also, note
that propagating inline asm code will spread potential bugs in them; so
watch out doubly for register constraints in such inline asm code.
