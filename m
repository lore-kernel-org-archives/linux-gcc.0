As already said, not much to ay w/o the full source.
However, you have allocated  a 4Kb buffer. possibly
you are reading beyond that limit into some memory space
not belonging to your program and when you try to free it,
you get a segfault. A wild guess, but is possible since you say this is
happening only for large files.
